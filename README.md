# XYZ Reader Starter Code

This repository initial commit stores the starter code for the XYZ Reader project in Udacity's Android Nanodegree.

XYZ Reader is a mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and headlines whose initial state is currently functional, and work in most cases for most users.

Subsequent commits will take user's feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design guidelines.
